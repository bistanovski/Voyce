<p>Did you ever wondered how to create your own mobile podcast application? Wonder no more, you have landed on the correct spot.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I will provide step by step configuration, and code walking for a simple, but fully functional mobile application that fetches podcas sources, parse retrieved details for episodes, their descriptions, and streaming of the audio data. We will explore how the episodes can be organized, saved in playlists etc. All of this relying on the powerful cross-platform framework - <a href="https://felgo.com/">Felgo</a>, which provide easy to use, ready components for building visual appealing user interfaces for multiple platforms.</p>

<h3 id="installing-felgo-sdk">Installing Felgo SDK</h3>
<p>Installation of the SDK is really simple, and here I will simply puth the links that explain what and where to download and install. If you are not registered on Felgo Website, you should go first to this <a href="https://felgo.com/signup">Signup Page</a>. Create account and once you are done go to the <a href="https://felgo.com/download">Downloads Page</a>. Once download is finished, start the executable, and proceed with installation. The process is really simple and straightforward.</p>
<p>If you have some difficulties, you can watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUXXjendkTY">Video</a> of the explained process of installing the SDK. Also, there is additional web page on which are described the dependencies which are required to be installed for each host OS - <a href="https://felgo.com/doc/felgo-installation/">Requirements</a>.</p>

<h3 id="add-felgo-packages-for-android-platform">Add Felgo packages for Android platform</h3>
<p>Since stock Felgo SDK is shipped with only basic packages for compiling applications for the host OS, we need to install additional packages if we want to run and deploy our application to Android device, or emulator.For this reason, we can follow this <a href="https://felgo.com/doc/felgo-deployment-android/">Article</a> to setup our environment with needed tools.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b><i>If you want to run the application on Android Emulator, you will need to select <b>Android (x86)</b> component too</i>.</p><a name="setup-android-emulator"></a>
<h3 id="setup-android-emulator">Setup Android emulator</h3>
<p>For this one, there already plenty of tutorials how you can set it up. The main sources that are valuable to you are: <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator">Run apps on the Android Emulator</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds">Create and manage virtual devices</a></p>
<a name="running-qt-creator"></a>
<h2 id="running-qt-creator">Running Qt Creator</h2>
<p>Once all of the previous steps are completely done, it's about time to run the Qt Creator - IDE for developing apps based on Felgo, Qt, QML and C++. You can find it in the default installation directory, or from your applications menu.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/QtCreator.png" alt="&quot;Qt Creator&quot;" /></p><a name="next-steps"></a>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Now that everything is set up, it's time to move forward and to create our basic application which will be worked on towards complete Podcast player - <b>Voyce</b></p>
